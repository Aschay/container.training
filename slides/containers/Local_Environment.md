# Getting started

What are we going to learn?

A multi-layered approach! ðŸ§…

- If you haven't used Docker yet: I'll show you how to get started.

- If you *have* already used Docker: I'll give you details, tips, tricks...

## Hands-on sections

- The whole workshop is hands-on

- We are going to build, ship, and run containers!

- The slides are here to help ...

- ... But most of the interesting action will be in the terminal

- You are invited to reproduce all the demos

  (if you feel like it!)

## What do we need?

- Docker!

  - on Linux

  - on Mac with Intel Silicon

  - on Mac with Apple Silicon

  - on Windows

- For the purpose of this workshop, there shouldn't be significant differences

  (but we'll talk about these differences a little bit later)
